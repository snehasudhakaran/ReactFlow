Overview

This project is a Flow Builder application built with React. It allows users to create and customize flow diagrams with nodes and edges.

Features

- Node Management: Users can add, remove, and customize nodes in the flow diagram.
- Edge Connections: Nodes can be connected with edges to represent relationships or dependencies.
- Node Settings: Users can modify settings and properties of individual nodes.
- Flow Saving: Users can save their flow diagrams, and the application will persist the data locally.
- Alert System: An alert system notifies users about important events or errors.

Usage

- Start the development server:
  npm start
- Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Project Structure

- src/components: Contains React components used to build the application.
- src/context: Contains Context API files for managing global state.
- src/home.css: Contains CSS styles for the application.
- src/App.js: Entry point of the application.
- public/index.html: HTML template for the application.

Dependencies

- React
- React Flow
- React Icons
- React Flow Renderer

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
